<p>Zona2D is a simple arcade 2D shooter created for the purpose of familiarizing myself with the game engine Unity and its features.<br>
During development, I acquired basic knowledge in scripting using the C# programming language and became acquainted with key components of the engine such as:<br>
  Transform;<br>
  Rigidbody;<br>
  Collider;<br>
  Particle system;<br>
  Animator;<br>
  Canvas;<br>
  Audio Clip Player.<br>
I learned to develop fundamental mechanics applicable to a wide range of games:<br>
  Controlling game elements via keyboard input;<br>
  Living creatures, their parameters, and behavior;<br>
  Melee weapons and firearms, including their characteristics and specifics;<br>
  Collectible items (health, experience, and ammunition);<br>
  Game interface;<br>
  Sound accompaniment;<br>
  Creating visual effects using particle systems;<br>
  Infinite map generation mechanic.<br>
All graphic elements and sprites were drawn by me using Aseprite.</p>

<p>Controls:<br>
  Movement — WASD;<br>
  Reload — R;<br>
  Shoot — Left Mouse Button;<br>
  Run — Shift;<br>
  Change weapon — Mouse Wheel;<br>
  Pause — Esc.</p>
